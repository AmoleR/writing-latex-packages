\maketitle

$\boxed{\floor 5}$
% The \boxed command is from the amsmath package, and thus will only
% work if we actually include it. The \floor command will work only
% if our package actually loaded properly (and the command we had
% was defined correctly), and this is affirmed as it should work.
